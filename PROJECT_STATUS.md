# Project Status

**Product:** Fieldline CRM  
**Repository:** `faizansaiyed123/testing`  
**Stable branch:** `main`  
**Status date:** 2026-09-25

## Current verified state

The backend and frontend product surface are merged into `main`.

### Backend

- FastAPI + PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy + Alembic.
- Multi-tenant organization/membership model with owner/admin/member roles.
- Argon2 password hashing.
- Short-lived signed access JWTs.
- Opaque refresh sessions with server-side hashes, rotation, row locking, CSRF binding, and secure-cookie production validation.
- Database-backed authentication throttling.
- Companies, contacts, pipeline stages, opportunities, tasks, activities, and audit events.
- Tenant-scoped CRUD/search/archive workflows with relationship validation.
- Customer 360 timeline with bounded SQL `UNION ALL` cursor pagination.
- Explainable attention queue.
- Idempotent workflow automation with auditable execution history.
- Transaction-safe contact CSV import with preview, validation, dry-run, duplicate detection, and atomic commit.
- Tenant-scoped saved views with definition versioning and execution.
- Deterministic relationship health.
- Standout operational layer: data-quality detection and controlled merge, daily work planner, stuck-opportunity detection, configurable business rules, relationship graph, automation history, and self-diagnostic system health.

### Frontend

- Next.js + React + TypeScript.
- Public landing page and authentication flow.
- Session restoration using the backend refresh-cookie/CSRF lifecycle.
- Responsive workspace shell.
- Dashboard and attention queue.
- Contacts and relationship-health inspection.
- Pipeline and opportunity creation.
- Saved-view creation and execution.
- CSV import preview, dry-run, and commit flow.
- Automation execution history.
- Daily planner.
- Data Quality Center with controlled merge UI.
- Relationship graph rendered as accessible SVG.
- Admin settings for business rules and system health.
- Error and 404 fallbacks.
- Mobile-safe responsive tables/drawers and keyboard-reachable interactive controls.

## Deep API verification

PR #15 added the authoritative deep API integration suite and was merged into `main` as commit `6fe66b12a95fe15ac310b642e961878256cca887`.

The suite:
- verifies the complete documented OpenAPI surface: **49 route templates/method combinations**;
- exercises every route through PostgreSQL-backed FastAPI TestClient calls;
- covers successful behavior, invalid input, authorization, tenant isolation, pagination/query bounds, lifecycle transitions, transaction side effects, and not-found paths;
- validates authentication, CSRF/session rotation/revocation, CRUD/archive, timeline, attention, relationship health/graph, automation, imports, saved views, and all standout operational endpoints.

The final authoritative backend run reported:

`76 passed, 1 warning in 4.71s`

A real defect found by this suite was fixed and merged: `/auth/logout` now explicitly returns HTTP 204 after revoking the refresh session and clearing cookies.

## Current CI verification

The latest `main` CI run (run #160) completed successfully on the current main head `6fe66b12a95fe15ac310b642e961878256cca887`.

Backend gate:

- Backend install: green.
- Ruff: green.
- Python compilation: green.
- Alembic migrations through `0012_standout`: green.
- Full backend pytest suite: green, including the 76-test deep API verification.

Frontend gate:
- npm install: green.
- TypeScript typecheck: green.
- Next.js production build: green.
- Chromium install: green.
- Browser smoke + standout suites: **5 passed**.

Real browser E2E gate:
- PostgreSQL startup: green.
- Migrations: green.
- Backend startup: green.
- Frontend production build: green.
- Chromium install: green.
- Real browser suites: **5 passed**.

## Database migration lineage

The active Alembic chain is linear:

`0001_bootstrap -> 0002_identity -> 0003_auth_sessions -> 0004_auth_rate_limits -> 0005_crm_core -> 0006_activity_tasks_audit -> 0007_timeline_indexes -> 0008_attention_indexes -> 0009_automation -> 0010_import_jobs -> 0011_saved_views -> 0012_standout`

No alternate stale migration branch is part of the active `main` lineage.

## Verification limitations

The local execution container does not provide the repository's Docker/PostgreSQL runtime or external package installation, so local live-DB verification is not claimed. Repository verification is based on the GitHub Actions PostgreSQL/Node/Chromium gates described above.

## Final quality gate

Before declaring any future slice complete:
1. inventory the affected routes and data flows;
2. add/extend integration tests before merge;
3. run the PostgreSQL-backed backend suite;
4. run frontend typecheck/build;
5. run browser smoke and real-backend E2E;
6. inspect tenant isolation, authorization, validation, transaction rollback, and failure recovery;
7. update this status file only after the relevant path has actually been exercised.

## Recovery rule

Before resuming after interruption, inspect Git refs, PR state, commits, migrations, tests, CI results, and existing implementation. Do not recreate completed work or rewrite useful history.

Never mark a feature verified unless its relevant code path and tests have actually been exercised.
